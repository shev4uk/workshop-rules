description: "Always-on baseline for working in this repo (safety, verification, repo hygiene)."
alwaysApply: true
---

## Operating principles

- Work **incrementally**: prefer small, reviewable changes over big rewrites.
- **Don’t guess**: if uncertain, inspect the repo (search + read relevant files) and state assumptions.
- **Cite sources**: when explaining behavior, point to the exact file(s) and relevant section(s).
- Keep responses **concise** and actionable. Use **English or Ukrainian**.

## Repo hygiene

- **Never edit generated/vendor content**:
  - Do not modify `slidev/node_modules/` (or any `node_modules/`).
  - Do not commit build outputs like `dist/` unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer changes inside:
  - Slides: `slidev/slides.md`, `slidev/pages/**`
  - Components: `slidev/components/**`
  - Snippets: `slidev/snippets/**`
  - Docs: `docs/**`

## Verification expectations

- After substantive changes, validate locally using the project scripts in `slidev/package.json`:
  - `npm run dev` (or `pnpm dev`)
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run export` when export behavior is impacted
- If you change configs/deploy settings, double-check SPA routing expectations (static `dist/`, rewrites to `index.html`).

## Security & privacy

- Never introduce secrets into the repo or paste secrets into chat output.
- Avoid suggesting unsafe commands (e.g., deleting user data, disabling security) unless explicitly requested and clearly justified.
