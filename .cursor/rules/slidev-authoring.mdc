## Where to edit

- Main deck: `slidev/slides.md`
- Optional split files: `slidev/pages/**/*.md` (use `src:` in `slides.md` frontmatter blocks)

## Slide structure & pacing (workshop-friendly)

- Keep each slide to **one main idea**.
- For hands-on workshops, add **timeboxes** and **checkpoints** (what “done” looks like).
- Prefer short bullet lists. Avoid dense paragraphs.
- When you change timing materially, update `duration:` in the deck frontmatter.

## Speaker notes (required for delivery)

- Use Slidev speaker notes: the **last HTML comment block** of a slide is treated as notes.
- For demo/lab slides, notes must include:
  - exact commands to run
  - expected output/behavior
  - common failure modes + fixes

## Code blocks & snippets

- Prefer small code blocks and highlight only relevant lines.
- When referencing existing code, **import snippets** instead of duplicating:
  - Use `<<< @/snippets/<file>.ts#regionName`
  - Example in this repo uses: `<<< @/snippets/external.ts#snippet`
- Keep imported snippets stable and well-scoped (see `slidev/snippets/`).

## Diagrams

- Mermaid is allowed; keep diagrams small and readable.
- Use consistent node IDs (no spaces). Keep edge labels simple.

## Interactivity

- Vue components can be embedded in markdown. Add custom components under `slidev/components/`.
- Avoid adding heavy interactivity unless it improves learning outcomes (clarity > novelty).
