## Snippets (`slidev/snippets/**`)

- Snippets should be **small**, **focused**, and **deterministic** (no flaky external dependencies).
- Use explicit snippet regions for import into slides:
  - Region markers like `// #region snippet` ... `// #endregion snippet`
  - Slides can import via `<<< @/snippets/<file>.ts#snippet`
- Keep snippet output stable across machines (Windows/macOS).

## TypeScript conventions

- Prefer readable, beginner-friendly TS even for intermediate audiences:
  - clear names, small functions, avoid clever types unless teaching them
- If a snippet logs output, keep it concise and meaningful for the slide narrative.
