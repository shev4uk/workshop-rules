## Documentation principles

- Prefer short sections with clear headings.
- Keep language consistent within a doc (Ukrainian or English).
- Link to canonical sources (repo files, official docs) instead of copying large text.

## PRD (`docs/PRD.md`)

- Treat `docs/PRD.md` as the canonical product definition.
- When updating scope or milestones, keep acceptance criteria and risks in sync.
