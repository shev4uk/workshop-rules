## Build outputs

- Slidev builds to a static site in `slidev/dist/` (deployment artifact).
- Do not hand-edit `dist/`; fix sources instead.

## Commands (run from `slidev/`)

- Install: `npm install` (or `pnpm install` if preferred)
- Dev: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Export: `npm run export` (PDF/export workflows)

## SPA routing expectations

- Netlify and Vercel are configured to rewrite routes to `index.html` for SPA behavior.
- If you change routing/paths, ensure rewrites still point all non-asset routes to `index.html`.

## Environment

- Prefer Node 20 for deploy parity (see `slidev/netlify.toml`).
