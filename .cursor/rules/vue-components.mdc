## Vue version & style

- Assume **Vue 3** (see `slidev/package.json`).
- Prefer `<script setup lang="ts">` for new/updated components.
- Keep components **small** and workshop-oriented (clarity > features).

## Component design

- Prefer **pure/presentational** components (props in, UI out). Avoid global side effects.
- If state is needed, keep it local and documented in comments.
- Keep props typed (TypeScript) and provide sensible defaults where appropriate.

## Slidev integration

- Components are embedded from markdown slides; ensure they render well at typical slide sizes.
- Avoid fetching network resources at runtime unless explicitly required for the workshop.
